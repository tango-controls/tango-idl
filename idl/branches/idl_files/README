Directory with the idl definition for tango. This directory contains the IDL 
as it is reallyused. The PSEUDO directory contains the IDL as it was
foreseen at the beginning of the project. The main file is

		tango.idl
	       
The html doc for the idl is stored in

               /segfs/tango/idl/idl_html
	       
	       
To generate files, the command syntax is the following:

1 - html doc for idl :

       	hidl -I. --all --output-dir idl_html tango.idl
	
2 - html doc for pseudo idl (After a cd to the PSEUDO directory)

       	hidl -DPSEUDO -I. --all --output-dir pidl_html tango.idl

    Du to a bug (I think) in the hidl OOC compiler, I had to manually insert
    a little html file (pseudo_text.html) which specify that it is a pseudo
    idl file.
